# CardGame
The classic game of Go Fish programmed in Java for my Grade 12 computer science course.

One of the requirements for this project was to use and demonstrate three classic sorting algorithms. Before you begin the game, you can choose which sorting algorithm you would like the program to take advantage of while you play.

# Instructions for Use
1. Open the CardGame folder and run CardGame.jar (PNG folder must be in the same folder as CardGame.jar for the application to work properly)
2. Check out my source code in src>CardGame
2. Have fun!

*Yes, the Dolphin is quite tricky! He is smarter than you think :)*
